    <h1>The Beginning of Something New (For Me)</h1>
    <p>Although this page appears to be quite barren, with nothing more than a white box on a not as white background, it must be imagined to be more. There is much more happening behind the scenes on this page than is ready to be seen.</p>
    <p>As such, I must (for now) leave you with nothing, save perhaps a slight curiosity or, more likely, an emotion that is equal parts upset and boredom.</p>
